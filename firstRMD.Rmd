This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
a <- 2
b <- 3
(c <- a+b)

(x <- 1:4)

y <- 32^2

(an_array <- 1:10)

#using cars data
# Define the cars vector with 5 values
cars <- c(1, 3, 6, 4, 9)

# Graph cars using blue points overlayed by a line 
plot(cars, type="o", col="blue")

# Create a title with a red, bold/italic font
title(main="Autos", col.main="red", font.main=4)

#histogram
hist(cars)
```
